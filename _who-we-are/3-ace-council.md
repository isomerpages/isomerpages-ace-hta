### **ACE Council**
The ACE Council was formed as an advisory body to steer the Agency’s development to drive appropriate healthcare in Singapore. Led by an eminent senior clinician, the Council comprises well-respected senior medical specialists and professionals across a range of disciplines.

The combined expertise and experience of Council members in medicine, research and academia, health economics, legal, social policy and government policy, present a holistic perspective to guide the Agency's development.

The Council's terms of reference:

1. Act as ambassadors to promote the values of evidence-based practice and appropriate care.

2. Ensure that the Agency’s strategic objectives, business plans, activities and outputs to guide effective clinical care are appropriate to Singaporeans' needs.

3. Advise MOH and the Agency’s executive team on strategic, implementation, performance and communication issues.

4. Guide collaborations and facilitate the development of networks and relationships with key stakeholders to support the development and/or implementation of ACE’s guidances and programmes.
