### **Our Organisation Structure**

The Agency for Care Effectiveness is a part of the Ministry of Health with an advisory council appointed by the Minister to steer the Agency’s long term development.

The Agency is led by our executive director, Dr Daphne Khoo, with two main branches, the evaluation branch headed by Mr Ng Kwong Hoe; and the planning and policy branch, headed by Ms Elaine Teo.

The evaluation branch conducts health technology assessments and develops guidance for drugs, devices and medical services, as well as appropriate care guides. They are also the secretariat for the relevant advisory committees in MOH.

The planning and policy branch manages corporate planning and administration, local and international collaborations for the Agency’s development, and is the secretariat to ACE's council. The branch also manages the engagement with policy divisions in the Ministry and external stakeholders to facilitate the adoption of ACE's guidances.
