### **Who we are**

The Agency for Care Effectiveness (ACE) is the national health technology assessment (HTA) agency in Singapore, established by the Ministry of Health in 2015 to drive better decision-making about clinically effective and cost-effective patient care.

### **Our vision**

To improve patient outcomes and healthcare value through health technology assessment

### **Our mission**

* To issue objective and credible healthcare guidance 
* To enable stakeholders to optimize health benefits within finite resources 
* To advance the values of evidence-based practice and appropriate care

### **Our core values**

Scientific Excellence. Collaboration. Impacting Lives.

### **What we do**

Advancements in medicine and the development of new health technologies offer the potential for improved healthcare in Singapore. However, some technologies, while costing more, may not offer significant advantages for patients. ACE aims to support policy-makers, clinicians and patients to make better decisions through health technology assessment (HTA).

ACE systematically evaluates health technologies, such as drugs, devices and medical services, using established HTA methods which take into account expert opinion and scientific evidence. The evaluations compare health technologies with alternative treatment options to identity interventions that are clinically effective and offer the best value for patients.

These evaluations equip policy makers with objective and credible evidence to guide subsidy decisions on healthcare treatments. In addition, ACE’s work will help healthcare institutions, doctors and patients in Singapore make better informed decisions on tests and treatments appropriate for their conditions.

From May 2017 onwards, ACE will be publishing guidances, which outline recommendations on the appropriate use of the health technologies evaluated, provide a brief summary of the rationale for the subsidy decision, as well as the key clinical and economic evidence which informed the recommendations. The publication of guidances increase the level of transparency of decision-making, and is consistent with how subsidy decisions are communicated by other HTA agencies internationally. ACE will also be publishing 'Appropriate Care Guides', which are concise sets of recommended care practices and pathways aimed at improving selected areas of therapy.
