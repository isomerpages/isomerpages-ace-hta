This Appropriate Care Guide (ACG) features new recommendations for screening and diagnosing gestational diabetes mellitus. It highlights the shift from risk-based to universal screening for all women at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation, and WHO 1999 to IADPSG 2010 glucose thresholds for GDM. It also highlights the importance of long-term care for women with GDM history.

### **Key Messages**

1.	During their first trimester, screen high-risk women for pre-existing diabetes using non-pregnancy glucose thresholds. If results are normal, re-evaluate women for GDM at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation.
2.	At 24 to 28 weeks of gestation, screen all pregnant women for GDM using 3-point 75 g OGTT unless they have pre-existing diabetes.
3.	At 6 to 12 weeks after delivery, reassess glycaemic status for women diagnosed with GDM using 2-point 75 g OGTT.
4.	Screen all women with GDM history for diabetes at least once every three years from then on.
