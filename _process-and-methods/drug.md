### **Drug evaluation process and methods**

**What is health technology assessment (HTA)?**

HTA is an established scientific research methodology to inform policy and clinical decision-making on the relative value of new health technologies, such as drugs, devices and medical services, compared to existing standards of care. It is conducted using analytical frameworks, drawing on clinical, epidemiological and health economic information to determine how best to allocate limited healthcare resources. 

HTA helps to answer the following questions:

* Does the health technology work?
* What benefit does it provide and for whom?
* What does it cost (to the healthcare service, to the patient, etc.), including opportunity costs?
* How does it compare with the available alternatives?

The goal of HTA is to inform the development of effective health policies about the use of health technologies in a manner that is patient-focused and achieves best value.

There are currently 3 main process steps which ACE follows when evaluating drugs to inform decision-making:

### **Topic submission and selection**

A call for applications is put out annually to the public healthcare institutions to submit requests for drug subsidy consideration. ACE works with the MOH Drug Advisory Committee (DAC) to select the topics for evaluation. 

### **Technical evaluation**

Once a topic is selected, technical evaluations are conducted at two levels - expedited or full – depending on the estimated budget impact and uncertainty around the clinical and cost parameters for each drug. All evaluations are conducted internally by the technical team in ACE, with supporting evidence provided by local clinical experts and pharmaceutical manufacturers. 

Higher cost technologies (estimated budget impact >$2 million a year) are typically subject to full evaluation which includes a systematic review of the clinical evidence, and economic modelling to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the technologies in the local context (where feasible);
Technologies with lower budget impact are subject to expedited evaluations (without modelling), which are usually informed by published clinical evidence and international cost-effectiveness studies.

Value-based pricing is conducted in parallel with drug evaluations to ensure that the price of drugs recommended for subsidy represents a cost-effective use of healthcare resources and is commensurate with the drugs' value in Singapore's context. Under this process, manufacturers are invited to submit their best cost prices for their drugs, which then inform ACE's cost-effectiveness analyses and budget impact assessments. 

### **Decision-making**

The evidence in ACE's technical evaluations informs the DAC's drug subsidy deliberations around four core decision-making criteria: 

* Clinical need of patients and nature of the condition
* Clinical effectiveness and safety of the drug
* Cost-effectiveness (value for money) – the incremental benefit and cost of the technology compared to existing alternatives
* Estimated annual cost of the drug and the number of patients likely to benefit from the technology

Additional factors, including social and value judgments, may also inform the DAC's considerations. 

On the basis of the available evidence, the DAC recommends whether a drug should receive subsidy through listing on the Standard Drug List (SDL) or the Medication Assistance Fund (MAF).
ACE's Drug Evaluation Methods and Process Guide (Version 1) outlines the core processes and methods underpinning ACE's assessment of clinical and economic evidence for drugs which are being considered for government subsidy. The guide also documents value-based pricing processes and the DAC's decision-making framework.
