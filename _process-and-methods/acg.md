### **Appropriate Care Guide (ACG) process and methods**

"Appropriate care guides" or ACGs provide concise and evidence-based recommendations on care practices and pathways to guide specific areas of clinical practice. Cost-effectiveness considerations are also incorporated where relevant. Where MOH Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are available, ACGs complement the CPGs by providing timely additions and updates as reflected in the evidence at the time of the ACG development. 

The following are the main process steps which ACE follows in the development of an ACG:

##### **Topic selection**
ACG topics are selected based on topics raised by MOH divisions and relevant professional bodies in the annual call for topics. In addition, ACGs are also developed as extensions of technology guidances (e.g. drug guidance) issued by ACE. 

Topics are shortlisted for development based on the following: 

* Alignment with national health priorities
* Disease burden
* Evidence of suboptimal outcomes
* Practice variation
* Knowledge gap
* Potential impact on patient outcomes

##### **Expert group**
Once topics are selected, an ACG expert group is appointed for each ACG topic to ensure that recommendations are accurate, current, and relevant for local practice and intended users. Each expert group consists of 8-12 practising health professionals who are subject matter experts including, but not limited to, specialists, general practitioners, pharmacists and nurses. 

##### **Literature review**
A step-wise approach is taken to review the literature, focusing on reviewing existing high-quality guidelines first before published literature. Reference guidelines are identified by the expert group and are assessed for quality using the AGREE II guideline assessment checklist. 

Additional literature searches and appraisals of primary or secondary literature are undertaken if there are: 

* few or no guideline(s) available
* gaps in the guidelines
* important updates in the evidence
* conflicting recommendations in the guidelines

##### **Cost-effectiveness**
Where applicable, cost-effectiveness considerations based on relevant technology guidances developed by ACE are included in the ACGs. Drugs or other medical technologies, available for subsidy through public healthcare institutions and primary care networks, are also highlighted in the ACGs. 

##### **Review and endorsement**
Professional bodies such as the Academy of Medicine and the College of Family Physicians are invited to provide comments and endorse the ACGs. 

##### **Development time and review**
The development of an ACG takes approximately 8-12 months. 

ACGs are reviewed three years after publication, or earlier if new evidence emerges that requires substantive changes to the recommendations.
